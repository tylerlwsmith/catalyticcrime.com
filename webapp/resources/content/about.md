My name is Tyler. I was born and raised in Bakersfield. My brother recently had his catalytic converted stolen during the night while parked on the street. A criminal might be able to sell the metals in a catalytic converter for $100, but to replace the converted it costs over $2,000 for the parts and labor, plus nearly another $2,700 for a rental car at $30/day (after insurance) because of the current shortage of catalytic converters.

I've watched as this problem has grow and several people a week posting on Facebook that their converters were stolen. My hope is that in building this site, we can centralize open data around this problem and maybe crowdsource finding the people responsible. My brother is fortunate to be in a place where he can manage this financial hardship, but for some families this could be devastating enough to drive them into homelessness.

I put this site together in a couple of weeks so it's rough around the edges, but if there's interest I'll keep building this out and adding features. If you have questions, you can email me at [tyler@deadhandmedia.com](mailto:tyler@deadhandmedia.com). I'll do my best to get back to you.
